The company manufactured an attachment to the centrifugal sand pump used on the river, which was developed by Herbert K. Lee to suit the specific circumstances of the Ottawa River. This innovation could also dredge the sawdust pollution downstream from the lumber industry.").openPopup();

McCaffrey of the Ottawa Sand and Gravel Company. This new pump allowed the company to collect “one and two large barge loads per day” to sell in the city for construction projects.");

The Canal Basin served as a base for commerce and industry. The Ottawa Sand and Gravel Company brought dredged sand from the Ottawa riverbed on steam barges, depositing it here for storage. From the Canal Basin, the sand was sold for construction projects, like the Nepean Point Bridge.");

Ashes from lumbering activities and from fireplaces was used as fertilizer. While potash – refined ash - was exported overseas in large barrels, people also used small amounts on their farms.

To make sure none were lost, they used long poles made from wood, with a heavy hook at the end. These are called pike poles.");

The pointer boat was designed by John Cockburn to float in shallow water, even when carrying a heavy load. The boats also needed to be sturdy enough to withstand the impact of logs floating on the water. They dotted the Ottawa River, bringing lumber to businesses on its shores.")

The powerhouse on the Perley and Pattee lumber yard was used by the Ottawa Electric Light Company to light up the city!")
