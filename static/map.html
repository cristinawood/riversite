						<p>This map places a few stories in the Ottawa River's industrial, commercial, and technological history. Explore it, and discover more details below.</p>

<h3>Moving the riverbed</h3>	
						<div class="col-4"><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></span></div> 
							<p>An 1889 article in the Ottawa Journal describes a local invention. A pump used to draw sand up from the riverbed, and onto a steam barge owned by W.A. McCaffrey of the Ottawa Sand and Gravel Company. This new pump allowed the company to collect “one and two large barge loads per day” to sell in the city for construction projects.</p>

						</br>
							<p>In the late nineteenth century, the Rideau Canal was a busy thoroughfare, with the Canal Basin serving as a base for commerce and industry. The Ottawa Sand and Gravel Company brought dredged sand from the Ottawa riverbed on steam barges, depositing it here for storage. From the Canal Basin, the sand could be sold for such construction projects as the Nepean Point bridge.</p>

							<p>The Chaudière Machine and Foundry Company was created by several machinists and coal merchants in 1895. They had an office at 85 Duke Street, and manufactured an attachment to the sand pump used on the river. It was developed by Herbert K. Lee to suit the specific circumstances of the Ottawa River. This innovative adaptation could dredge the sawdust pollution produced by the lumber industry upstream. </p>

<h4>Lumbering on the Ottawa</h4>
						<div class="col-4"><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic10.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
						</br>
							<p>Cut logs were floated down the river in groups, and manipulated by lumbermen on boats or rafts. Sometimes, they jumped and danced from log to log. To make sure none were lost, they used long poles made from wood, with a heavy hook at the end. These are called <a href="https://ingeniumcanada.org/ingenium/collection-research/collection-item.php?id=1985.0274.001">"pike poles."</a></p>

							<p>As the lumber industry boomed, people realized they would need specialized equipment to transport logs downriver. The pointer boat was designed by John Cockburn to float in shallow water, even when carrying a heavy load. The boats also needed to be sturdy enough to withstand the impact of logs floating on the water. They dotted the Ottawa River, bringing lumber to businesses on its shores.</p>

<h4>Powering city life</h4>
								
						<div class="col-4"><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic14.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
						</br>
							<p> To use electricity in late-nineteenth century Ottawa, companies needed access to water. They often took advantage of technologies already in place, like waterwheels and turbines used to drive sawmills and converted them to generate power. The powerhouse on the Perley and Pattee lumber yard was used by the Ottawa Electric Light Company to light up the city!</p>

<h4>Cultivating its shores</h4>
								
						<div class="col-4"><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>	
						</br>
							<p> E.B. Eddy and his company were central in the lumber trade in the nineteenth century. An Eddy Company accounting ledger from 1885 reveals a small shipment of potash kettles up the river. These heavy iron pots were used to refine wood ashes into potash for export, and were a common technology among settlers clearing land.</p>

							<p>From as early as 1843, Kettle Island was home to several farmers who cleared the land for cultivation and grew small crops. Ashes from lumbering activities and from fireplaces was used as fertilizer. While potash – refined ash - was exported overseas in large barrels, people also used small amounts on their farms. The farmers on Kettle Island were no different! </p>
